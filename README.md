# Credit_Risk_Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis 
### The purpose of this repository is to run six machine learning modules to look at the different balanced accuracy and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning modules. 
### Results
* ### Random Over Sampler Model
For the Random Over Sample Model, the accuracy is 0.65 with a precision for high risk at 0.01 and a precision for low risk at 1.00. A huge discrepancy amongst the two values. However, the recall scores for high risk and low risk are similar at 0.68 and 0.61.

* ### SMOTE Oversampling Model
For the SMOTE Oversampling Model, the accuracy score is 0.62. Similarly to the random over sampler method, the precision for high risk is at 0.01 and 1.00 for low risk. The recall scores for high risk is at 0.61 and very similar for low risk at 0.64.

* ### Cluster centroids Model
For the Cluster Centroids Model, the accuracy score is 0.51. The precision score for high risk is 0.01 and 1.00 for low risk. While the recall score for high risk is 0.60 and low risk 0.43.

* ### SMOTENN Model 
  The SMOTENN Method has an accuracy score of 0.64. A precision score of 0.01 for high risk and 1.00 for low risk. The recall scores are .70 for high risk and 0.58 for low risk.
